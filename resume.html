								<p>My name is Petar Zivkovic. I live in Puyallup, WA with my lovely wife and our pets. I was born and raised in Serbia, before moving to the Puget Sound in 2014. Growing up in Europe gave me a real passion for history and traveling. I love learning and consider myself a student for life.
                                    
                                <p></p>I am currently enrolled in the vigorus Trilogy Coding Boot Camp through University of Washington. I feel empowered by the tools I have been given during this experience. Now, I am actively seeking new employment oppertunities that will let me flex my creative muscles.</p>

                                <p></p>Prior to getting into the IT feild, I worked construction installing residential Natural Gas. When the COVID-19 pandamic hit, my world, our world, changed dramatically. During that time I was able to focus on what I really wanted to do. I started researching how I could get my foot into the IT world. I was looking at colleges, but quickly realized that boot camps offered a wealth of knowledge and techniques in an efficent timeframe. I decided to hold off on enrolling in college so I could first aquire relavent certificates, get into the industry and then continue to a Bachalor's degree.
                                <p></p>My personal and
                                    professional background has challenged me to adapt many times. Through hard work and
                                    perseverance, I have overcome these obstacles and succeeded. I'm excited to see what the future will bring.  </p>
