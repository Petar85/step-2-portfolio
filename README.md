# step-2-portfolio
I used one of those HTML5 up templates to start seriously working on my resume. I have started to refactor it and restyle it to fit my needs and personality. Unfortanately due to very busy last week I could not finish it, but I am very excited to use my knowledge and built nice portfolio website. I am not even sure that this is going to be me my final option.
